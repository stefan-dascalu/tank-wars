## Design Overview

Tank Wars is an interactive, real-time tank battle game inspired by the classic "Tank Wars" but with a more dynamic and continuous gameplay experience. The implementation leverages object-oriented programming (OOP) and advanced mathematical techniques to simulate realistic terrain, tank mechanics, projectile physics, and collision detection.

### Problem Breakdown
- **Terrain Generation and Rendering:**  
  - The terrain is generated by sampling a complex function composed of multiple sine waves, resulting in a realistic height map.
  - This height map is stored in a vector and rendered as a mesh using techniques such as triangle strips or rasterized polygons.
  - Mathematical transformations (translation, scaling, rotation, and shearing) are applied to render the terrain accurately within the game world.

- **Tank Mechanics:**  
  - Tanks are dynamically positioned and oriented based on the underlying terrain. Their rotation is computed using functions like `atan2` to align with the slope, ensuring realistic movement.
  - Each tank is constructed using OOP principles; its base, turret, and gun are created programmatically. This modular design facilitates smooth control and easier maintenance.
  - Tanks adapt to the terrain by adjusting their position and rotation, while their turret can be rotated independently for precise aiming.

- **Projectile and Collision System:**  
  - Projectiles are fired from the tanks based on the turret’s angle, with trajectories calculated using vector mathematics and gravitational acceleration.
  - Collision detection is handled through distance checks and linear interpolation, ensuring accurate interactions with both tanks and the terrain.
  - On impact, explosions are triggered and the terrain is deformed to simulate realistic damage, adding an extra layer of dynamic gameplay.

- **Additional Visual Effects:**  
  - Dynamic explosions, moving clouds, and health bars enrich the visual experience.
  - A trajectory guide helps players adjust their shots, while explosions and terrain deformations provide immediate feedback on projectile impacts.

### Implementation Details
- **Object-Oriented Design:**  
  The project is structured into distinct classes:
  - **`Terrain`:** Generates a height map from mathematical functions and renders the terrain, while also managing terrain deformations upon impact.
  - **`Tank`:** Handles positioning, movement, rotation, turret control, and health, with its orientation computed based on the terrain slope.
  - **`Projectile`:** Simulates projectile motion using physics formulas and manages collision detection with both terrain and tanks.
  - **`Explosion` & `Cloud`:** Create dynamic visual effects that enhance realism and game immersion.

- **Mathematical Computations:**  
  Mathematics is at the core of Tank Wars:
  - **Terrain Generation:** Uses sine functions (and optionally other curves) to produce a varied and realistic terrain profile.
  - **Transformations:** Applies translation, rotation, scaling, and shearing matrices to correctly position and animate game objects.
  - **Collision Detection & Physics:** Utilizes vector arithmetic and linear interpolation to simulate projectile motion and precisely detect collisions.

**Implementation:** The full implementation is located in `src/lab_m1/Tema1`. The rest of the repository contains my lab work and other assignments.
